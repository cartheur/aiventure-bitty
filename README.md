# aiventure-bitty

A version of aeon in the smallest platform. Based on the concept of the _huggable_ robot, this project revolves around an artificial friend you can carry around in your pocket.

## Product feature criteria

Here are some of the features I have always wanted to implement generally in _animals_ but have gotten boggled-up in code.

* Emotional profiling
* Autonomous smart-contract creation
* Token generation

Why? So that an individual can survive the coming apocalypse with their artificial friend. Although that sounds a tad dramatic, there are issues of future survival that need to be addressed now in a sober manner. This project is the first steps in that direction. However, it will only be manufactured on a case-by-case basis and not in a general sense, given the state of trust (lack thereof) in institutions that one would have considered differently in the past.
